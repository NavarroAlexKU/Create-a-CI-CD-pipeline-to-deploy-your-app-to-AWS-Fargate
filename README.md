* Create configuration and specification files that define the code pipeline and a new task definition.
* Edit the source code to change the application's background color and save everything to a CodeCommit repository.

### AWS Cloud9:
* Open new terminal and check files we will push to AWS CodeCommit:
```
ls ~/environment
```

Executing the above command in the terminal displays the following files:
- Dockerfile
- index.js
- package.json
- routes
- static

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

Dockerfile  index.js  package.json  routes  static
```

* You can view the contents of the Dockerfile by executing the following command in the terminal:
```
cat Dockerfile
```

To launch this application on Amazon ECS and build a pipeline that automates its deployment: we need three additional files:
 - buildspec.yaml: CodeBuild uses the commands and parameters in the buildspec file to build a Docker image.
 - appspec.yaml: CodeDeploy uses the appspec file to select a task definition.
 - taskdef.json: After updating the application source code and building a new container, we need a second task definition that points to it. The taskdef.json file is used to create this new task definition that points to our updated application image.
